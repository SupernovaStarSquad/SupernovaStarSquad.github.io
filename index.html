                      After getting back from the First Robotics Conferance in Sydeny, run by Team 3132 "Thunder Down Under", it was a quick
                      scramble to get everyone in our school aware of our program within the last two days of our school term.
                      Being a first year rookie team, we decided that it might be a good idea to run an information seminar
                      of sorts in the library at lunch. We managed to get over 20 interested students to join our team!
                      </p>
                      <p id="paragraphTwo">
                      Now each year, on the last day of school, we have a tradition where the year 11s vs the staff in a cricket match.
                      We managed to convice our principal to let us have the library for the day instead, and got everyone that was interested
                      in being apart of the competition, to join us. While the rest of the school was praying that it wouldn't rain while they
                      were out on the town oval, we were hard at work, focusing our energy into sorting out some pre-kickoff issues.

                      After recieving the materials to build our robot, a few members of our team got together and headed up to the observatory
                      where we went through our boxes of equipment which would soon become our robot, it was quite exciting to see what we had to work
                      with. We also had a chance to meet our mentors who have been generous enough to volunteer their time to guide us through
                      the building process, as a rookie team we need as much guidance as we can possibly get to ensure that our team is on the
                      right track. We have a group of around 20 dedicated mentors from the observatory who are expert in everything from
                      electronics to construction which is a really good asset to our team.

                      On the 17th of January a few of the team members went back to the school after meeting our mentors to start putting together
                      the base of our robot, we were really excited to get the robot started so we stayed at school until 5 in the afternoon, much
                      to the dismay of the teachers who really just wanted to go home after a whole day of robotics. We were up at 10am the next
                      morning back at the school with the rest of our team to show them what we had achieved the day before, we continued to work
                      on the robot on the robot for the rest of that day and after about a day of working on it, we had the base built. We met up
                      again the next day to start on the electronics and prototyping which we continued on the following Monday and Tuesday, our
                      goals at the moment are to get the robot moving and for us to learn how to drive it.
