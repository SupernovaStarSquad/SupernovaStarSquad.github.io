                      After getting back from the First Robotics Conferance in Sydeny, run by Team 3132 "Thunder Down Under", it was a quick
                      scramble to get everyone in our school aware of our program within the last two days of our school term.
                      Being a first year rookie team, we decided that it might be a good idea to run an information seminar
                      of sorts in the library at lunch. We managed to get over 20 interested students to join our team!

                      <p id="paragraphTwo">
                      Now each year, on the last day of school, we have a tradition where the year 11s vs the staff in a cricket match.
                      We managed to convice our principal to let us have the library for the day instead, and got everyone that was interested
                      in being apart of the competition, to join us. While the rest of the school was praying that it wouldn't rain while they
                      were out on the town oval, we were hard at work, focusing our energy into sorting out some pre-kickoff issues.
